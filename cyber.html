    <h2 style="color: rgb(0, 68, 255);">What is Cybersecurity?</h2>
    The best way to think about cybersecurity is by imagining that it’s a security guard for computer activities. Cybersecurity is different technologies, programs, and ideas that protect people and companies. It keeps information safe that’s stored on a computer, on the internet, or any device.
    
    The main focus of cybersecurity is to keep personal and business information out of the hands of people who shouldn’t have access. It protects not only your online presence but also your local computer. Any electronic device relies on cybersecurity to keep it operational and keep the user, and user data, safe.
    <br><br>
    <h2 style="color: rgb(0, 68, 255);">Why is Cybersecurity Important?</h2>
Cybersecurity is one of the most important fields of study today. Think about every time you use the internet. Now imagine someone has direct access to that information.

It might not seem like a big deal for some people, but think about it this way: Hospitals, government agencies, and substantial corporate entities use computers non-stop. More importantly, they’re storing classified and sensitive information on these computers. If this information goes out to the public, who knows how many lives will be ruined.

Social security numbers, credit card info, addresses, banking information, and passwords to different sites are all up for grabs without proper cybersecurity.
<br><br>
<h2 style="color: rgb(0, 68, 255);">Careers in Cybersecurity</h2>
<strong>Forensic Computer Analyst</strong> <br>
Imagine a forensic computer analyst as a detective. They get called after a security breach, and they follow the clues to find the culprit. They might use techniques to recover deleted data, use special programs for tracking, or look into server information.

A lot of times, their findings are used in court for litigation. They don’t necessarily prevent attacks, but they aim to find who made the attack.
<br><br>
<strong>Information Security Analyst (ISA)</strong> <br>
The ISA is what you might expect when you think about working in cybersecurity. These are the security guards. Their sole responsibility is to protect data for a company’s computers and network.

They’ll control programs, add encryption measures, maintain the firewalls, update the cybersecurity framework, and prevent data leaks. In some cases, the ISA might be called on to help retrieve information after a cyberattack. The ISA most likely knows the computer system and network better than anybody else at the company. They are the first defense for cybersecurity management.

When working as an ISA, you must stay up-to-date with the newest technology and methods to find and eliminate advanced persistent threats. The ISA has to stay ahead of the hacker at all times.
<br><br>
<strong>Penetration Tester</strong> <br>
A penetration tester is a unique role in a company. They are often brought in for single projects on contract. Their primary function is to hack into that company’s network with their authorization.

In other words, penetration testers are almost like hackers for hire. Companies will pay them to find vulnerabilities in their systems. The penetration tester will hack their way into the system, then outline all of the weaknesses and how the company can plug those holes. The company will take those notes and roll out fixes to make sure illegal hackers don’t take advantage of their system in the future.

The best way to prevent a hacker is to hire one ahead of time.
<br><br>
<strong>IT Security Engineer</strong> <br>
Information technology security engineering is where cybersecurity meets traditional engineering. This role will analyze systems from an engineer’s perspective and design fixes. Their significant task is to design security systems that work well to ensure people don’t exploit the company later.

They’ll also maintain systems for companies. They use knowledge of general data protection regulation to find the best methods to fend off hackers. They might also implement automatic scripts that detect when a security incident happens and report it in live time.

Often this role is filled by a programmer who can write scripts and codes for different operating systems and various coding languages. There’s a lot of critical thinking, math, and engineering methods used in this role.
<br><br>
<strong>Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)</strong> <br>
The CISO was mentioned earlier; it’s an executive-level path for some cybersecurity experts. This role oversees the cybersecurity work at a given company. They plan and direct the security work for their employers, and they interface with management at the company.

The CISO is the leader of the cybersecurity team, so they need to know a lot about IT security and have the skills to lead a team. For larger companies, the CISO needs experience in different cybersecurity roles to make sure they can keep a large team organized and on track.
